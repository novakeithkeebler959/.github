## 💡 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also clean, readable, and maintainable. I follow best practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and Agile methodologies. I’m a strong advocate for open-source software and actively contribute to various projects.  

## 🌱 Current Interests  
I’m currently exploring:  
- **Machine Learning**: Building and deploying ML models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
- **Blockchain**: Developing decentralized applications (dApps) with Ethereum and Solidity.  
- **Rust**: Learning Rust for systems programming and performance-critical applications.
